                                <p>For most experimental studies, payments range from $20 to $25 an hour on average. You will also receive $5 as a sign-up award. You will receive this sign-up award for coming and listening to the instructions. To receive any payment, you must arrive on time!</p>

                                <p>Send an email to the ULEEF administrator at uleef@business.utah.edu, and we will remove you. We will deactivate your account, and you will no longer receive emails. Just send us an email if you ever want back in.</p>

                            <div class="expanded-content" id="faq">
                                <p>You only register once by filling out the participant registration form. After you have registered, you will receive email notifications for experimental sessions that you are eligible to participate in. You can sign up for the individual sessions that fit into your schedule.</p>

                            <div class="expanded-content" id="faq">
                                <p>If you haven't participated in over a year, it is very likely that your account has been deactivated. Simply send an email to uleef@business.utah.edu, and we will reactivate your account.</p>

                            <h2 class="headline" id="faq"><span class="down-arrow" id="faq"></span>Where is the ULEEF?</h2>
                            <div class="expanded-content" id="faq">
                                <p>ULEEF is a virtual laboratory. Experimental sessions can take part in any computer lab on campus provided that there is an internet connection. Most often, the studies are conducted in SFEBB 5140. This is the new business building. Take the elevators to the fifth floor. Turn right as you exit the elevators, and the lab is in the first small hallway to your left (it is a small hallway and can easily be missed).</p>

                            <h2 class="headline" id="faq"><span class="down-arrow" id="faq"></span>How long do the studies last?</h2>
                            <div class="expanded-content" id="faq">
                                <p>The average study lasts between 1 and 3 hours. The hours for the study are listed in the invitation email. Although many experiments finish early, you should always be prepared to stay the whole time.</p>
                            </div>
                        </div>

                            <h2 class="headline" id="faq"><span class="down-arrow" id="faq"></span>There are restrictions when I try to sign up for an experiment. Why?</h2>
                            <div class="expanded-content" id="faq">
                                <p>The reason why you are restricted is because 1) you may have participated in this experiment previously, 2) you are probably signed up for the same experiment already, and 3) special filters were requested by the researchers for the sake of research purposes.</p>

                            <div class="expanded-content" id="faq">
                                <p>Please send an email to uleef@business.utah.edu. Many of our studies require an exact number of participants, and your advance cancellation (as opposed to a 'no show') is very important to us. If you repeatedly sign up and then fail to attend, you may lose your eligibility to participate.</p>

                            <div class="expanded-content" id="faq">
                                <p>We realize that emergencies will come up. It would be helpful to send an email to uleef@business.utah.edu. But please note: If you repeatedly sign up and then fail to attend, you may lose your eligibility to participate.</p>

                            <div class="expanded-content" id="faq">
                                <p>No, because there is no way for the researcher to check your eligibility status. You will not be paid if you are not on the researcher's list.</p>

                            <div class="expanded-content" id="faq">
                                <p>In most studies, your earnings are based on your decisions and sometimes random luck. Some people will earn more than others. Sometimes you will earn more than the average, and sometimes you will earn less.</p>

                            <div class="expanded-content" id="faq">
                                <p>Many of the experiments conducted in the ULEEF involve a number of participants who make decisions over a computer network. Your decisions and the decisions of others will often affect your earnings. As a result, your earnings can vary from study to study, but your earnings are always kept private. The research hypotheses come from a large range of business-related disciplines such as economics, psychology, sociology, and finance. We accept participants from all backgrounds; you don't need to be a business expert to participate and do well. Feel free to ask researchers to give you more details about their study after you are finished.</p>

                                <p>You will be paid in cash at the end of the study. You will need to sign a receipt. The experimenter will not reveal the amount you are paid to other participants.</p>
